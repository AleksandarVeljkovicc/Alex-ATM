# Run the app
To start the application, navigate to the frontend directory and run the command npm run dev.
To start the tests, navigate to the backend directory and run the command php vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox tests/unit.
For the app to work, install the WAMP server and position the folder exactly in the www folder to not mess up the routes.
PHP 8.2 or higher is a must.
